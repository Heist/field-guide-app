			<h3>How much does Field Guide cost?</h3>
			<p>Field Guide is always free for your first 30 days. After 30 days, you need to sign up for a paid plan, which you can <a href="/pricing">learn more about here</a>. </p>
			
			<h3>What if I want to delete my account?</h3>
			<p>To close your account, first go to the <strong>Account</strong> page. Then go to the Settings tab, click <strong>Delete Account</strong>. If you’re on a paid account, payments will be immediately stopped. When you close your account, you can export all of your data. That way you still have access to all your notes and information. </p>
			
			<h3>What is an Observer?</h3>
			<p>An <strong>observer</strong> is a team member on your account who can watch and participate in your tests. Observers can’t build tests, comment on, or edit reports. They can help you take notes while you’re testing&mdash;this is a great way to include stakeholders and coworkers in the research process. </p>
			
			<h3>How do I get my Prototypes of Websites into Fieldguide?</h3>
			<p>I’m glad you asked&mdash;this is actually one of the coolest features of Field Guide! You can use Field Guide to see exactly what a test participant is doing. Download the <a href="#">Field Guide app</a> (Sorry! iOS-only for now, coming soon to an App Store near you!) on your testing device. If you are testing remotely, tell the test participant to download the app ahead of time. <br><br>
			
			<h3>How do I connect the device to my test?</h3>
			When testing that Project in Field Guide, you&rsquo;ll be asked to enter a <strong>Room Number</strong>. Once the app is installed on your device, look for the <strong>Room Number</strong> on the app&rsquo;s homescreen. If you’re testing remotely, ask your participant for their Room ID. Add the Room ID in your test, and the two will sync&mdash;your mobile device and the web app are now paired!</p>
			
			
			<h2 id="faq-terminology">Terminology</h2>
			
			<h3>What is a Project?</h3>
			<p>A Project is a container for all of your tests and test results. Say you’re testing a new user flow in a mobile app&mdash;your Project might be called New User Flow. You can test a single Project with users as many times as you’d like&mdash;the test results will be automatically organized for you.</p>
			
			<h3>What is a discussion guide? </h3>
			<p>A discussion guide is the set of questions that you want to ask test participants, or actions you'd like them to perform. In Field Guide we call those questions or actions <strong>tasks</strong>.</p>
			
			<h3>What are tasks?</h3>
			<p>If your Project is a book, think of tasks like its chapters. For example, let’s say you’re testing out your site’s new homepage. One task might be “comprehension”&mdash;does the user understand the page’s contents? Another task might be “registration”&mdash;is the user able to find the sign-up portion of the page and adequately register? <strong>How you define tasks is completely up to you.</strong> After using Field Guide a few times, you’ll discover what works best for you and your team.</p>
			
			<h3>What is a <span class="tag">#theme</span>?</h3>
			<p>A theme is a particular subject or issue that is discussed often or repeatedly during your tests, and is tracked in Field Guide using the <strong>#</strong> symbol, like hashtags on Twitter. Maybe a lot of your test participants have difficulty discovering where to sign-up? When you take notes related to this particular difficulty, you can add the hashtag #signup to link those notes together. </p>
			
			<h3 id="faq-features">What is a report?</h3>
			<p>A report is the organized output of all the tests that you’ve run, in a single Project. Think of it like a project’s summary. Reports can be shared freely within your company, or sent to clients. <strong>You don&rsquo;t need a Field Guide account to view reports.</strong></p>
			
			
			<h2 id="faq-features">Features &amp; Use</h2>

			<h3>How do I add team members to my account?</h3>
			<p>Goi to your account settings, click the <strong>Invite a new team member</strong> button, and you’ll be able to add your new team member via their e-mail. Note: when adding a new team member, your monthly plan cost will also be adjusted.</p>
			
			<h3>I’m having trouble with the iOS app.</h3>
			<p>Join us on our support <a href="https://fieldguide.typeform.com/to/qrRHYS">Slack</a> channel and someone will help you diagnose your problem.</p>
			
			<h3>What can I test with Field Guide?</h3>
			<p>Great question! Check out the <a href="#">What can you test</a> section of the site to get some ideas. </p>
			
			<h3>Why isn't my mobile or tablet InVision prototype isn’t working, why?</h3>
			<p>When you generate a share link in InVision, click on “more options”, then turn off “Force ‘Add to homescreen’”. It should work correctly after that.
				<br><br>

			</p>
			
			<h3>How can I get my Framer mobile or tablet prototype into Field Guide?</h3>
			<p>Easy! In the newest version of Framer Studio (1.9.7) you can just hit the Share button in the top right of the application widow. This should generate a URL for you and automatically open it in your default browser, simply copy that URL and paste it into the Prototype input when creating a Project.<br><br>
				<img src="../img/faq-framer.gif" />
			</p>
			
			<h3>Can I use a Marvel prototype in Field Guide?</h3>
			<p>No problem &mdash; just copy the URL that Marvel provides and paste it into the Prototype input when creating a Project.<br><br>
